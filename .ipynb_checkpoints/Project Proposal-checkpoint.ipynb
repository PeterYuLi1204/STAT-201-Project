    "Students who participate in extracurricular activities, such as regular artistic or physical activities, can gain additional transferable skills. Yet, there are concerns that this involvement may come at the cost of dedicating less time to academic studies, leading to negative performance in school. However, an analytical research paper by Ribeiro (2023) reveals that the majority of past clinical trials found a positive correlation between extracurricular activities and academic success. Extracurricular activities had benefits for mental health and suicide prevention among college students, contributing to better grades in school. Similarly, another study found that it enhances leadership, time management, and social skills, ultimately contributing to improved academic performance (Christison, 2013). A study by Wang (2023) found that students who participated in extracurricular activities received similar grades as students who did not, suggesting that participation in extracurricular activities does not compromise academic performance. Collectively, these studies consistently show a positive correlation between extracurricular activities and academic success. Our statistical analysis aims to confirm the validity of this trend."
